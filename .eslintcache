It has been continually occupied, in one form or another, from the Iberian era (4th century B.C) to present. During the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939) the Republican anti-air defence authority (DECA) found that the hill was the most suitable place to build its anti-aircraft battery, which was instrumental in republican efforts to defend Barcelona. Post Spanish Civil-War the then abandoned military structures were used as shelters and the shanty town of Els Canons, which survived into the ‘90s, sprung up around them. Also during this time, water tanks and communication towers were installed, some of which can still be seen to this day.</p></div>\r\n        </div>\r\n    )\r\n}",["41","42"],"C:\\Users\\mehme\\codes\\mywebsite\\src\\views\\Sagrada.js",["43","44","45","46","47","48"],"import React,{useState} from \"react\";\r\nimport {Route,Link,Switch}from \"react-router-dom\";\r\nimport \"./sagrada.css\";\r\n\r\n\r\nexport default function Sagrada(){\r\n\r\n\r\n    return(\r\n        <div className=\"sagrada\">\r\n        \r\n        <div className=\"contend\"><img className=\"bild\" src=\"https://go2barcelona.de/images/barcelona_sagrada_familia.jpg\"></img></div>\r\n\r\n        <div className=\"text1\">The Sagrada Familia (full name Basílica i Temple Expiatori de la Sagrada Família) is a large Roman Catholic church in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain. It was designed by architect Antoni Gaudí (1852–1926). Although it is not finished, the church is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.[5] In November 2010 it was consecrated (dedicated to a special purpose) and made a minor basilica by Pope Benedict XVI.[6][7][8] Building of the Sagrada Familia began in 1882. Gaudi started working on it in 1883.[5] He took over the project, and changed it with his ideas on architecture and engineering. Gaudi worked on it until he died. At the time of his death in 1926, less than a quarter of the building was finished.[9] The Sagrada Família's building was slow. It needed private donations (people giving money to it). It was stopped by the Spanish Civil War—only to start again in the 1950s. Building was more than halfway done after 2010. Some of the project's biggest problems still remain.[9]</div>\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <iframe className=\"frame\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/AWQje34khog\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n        \r\n        </div>\r\n    )\r\n}","C:\\Users\\mehme\\codes\\mywebsite\\src\\views\\Next.js",["49","50","51","52"],"import React,{useState} from \"react\";\r\nimport {Route,Link,Switch}from \"react-router-dom\";\r\nimport \"./next.css\"\r\n\r\nexport default function Next(){\r\n\r\n\r\n    return(\r\n        <div className=\"next\">\r\n            Work in progress.... coming soon!\r\n        </div>\r\n    )\r\n}","C:\\Users\\mehme\\codes\\mywebsite\\src\\views\\Gaudi.js",["53","54","55","56","57","58"],{"ruleId":"59","severity":1,"message":"60","line":18,"column":53,"nodeType":"61","endLine":18,"endColumn":56},{"ruleId":"62","severity":1,"message":"63","line":45,"column":14,"nodeType":"61","endLine":45,"endColumn":251},{"ruleId":"64","severity":1,"message":"65","line":2,"column":9,"nodeType":"66","messageId":"67","endLine":2,"endColumn":14},{"ruleId":"64","severity":1,"message":"68","line":2,"column":15,"nodeType":"66","messageId":"67","endLine":2,"endColumn":19},{"ruleId":"64","severity":1,"message":"69","line":2,"column":20,"nodeType":"66","messageId":"67","endLine":2,"endColumn":26},{"ruleId":"64","severity":1,"message":"70","line":4,"column":8,"nodeType":"66","messageId":"67","endLine":4,"endColumn":12},{"ruleId":"62","severity":1,"message":"63","line":32,"column":47,"nodeType":"61","endLine":32,"endColumn":279},{"ruleId":"71","replacedBy":"72"},{"ruleId":"73","replacedBy":"74"},{"ruleId":"64","severity":1,"message":"75","line":1,"column":15,"nodeType":"66","messageId":"67","endLine":1,"endColumn":23},{"ruleId":"64","severity":1,"message":"65","line":2,"column":9,"nodeType":"66","messageId":"67","endLine":2,"endColumn":14},{"ruleId":"64","severity":1,"message":"68","line":2,"column":15,"nodeType":"66","messageId":"67","endLine":2,"endColumn":19},{"ruleId":"64","severity":1,"message":"69","line":2,"column":20,"nodeType":"66","messageId":"67","endLine":2,"endColumn":26},{"ruleId":"76","severity":1,"message":"77","line":12,"column":34,"nodeType":"61","endLine":12,"endColumn":123},{"ruleId":"62","severity":1,"message":"63","line":17,"column":9,"nodeType":"61","endLine":17,"endColumn":237},{"ruleId":"64","severity":1,"message":"75","line":1,"column":15,"nodeType":"66","messageId":"67","endLine":1,"endColumn":23},{"ruleId":"64","severity":1,"message":"65","line":2,"column":9,"nodeType":"66","messageId":"67","endLine":2,"endColumn":14},{"ruleId":"64","severity":1,"message":"68","line":2,"column":15,"nodeType":"66","messageId":"67","endLine":2,"endColumn":19},{"ruleId":"64","severity":1,"message":"69","line":2,"column":20,"nodeType":"66","messageId":"67","endLine":2,"endColumn":26},{"ruleId":"64","severity":1,"message":"75","line":1,"column":15,"nodeType":"66","messageId":"67","endLine":1,"endColumn":23},{"ruleId":"64","severity":1,"message":"65","line":2,"column":9,"nodeType":"66","messageId":"67","endLine":2,"endColumn":14},{"ruleId":"64","severity":1,"message":"68","line":2,"column":15,"nodeType":"66","messageId":"67","endLine":2,"endColumn":19},{"ruleId":"64","severity":1,"message":"69","line":2,"column":20,"nodeType":"66","messageId":"67","endLine":2,"endColumn":26},{"ruleId":"76","severity":1,"message":"77","line":14,"column":14,"nodeType":"61","endLine":14,"endColumn":147},{"ruleId":"76","severity":1,"message":"77","line":30,"column":1,"nodeType":"61","endLine":30,"endColumn":244},"jsx-a11y/anchor-is-valid","The href attribute is required for an anchor to be keyboard accessible.
