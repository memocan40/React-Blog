            <p className="textgaudi">History of Park Güell
Park Güell is named after Eusebi Güell, a wealthy Catalonian entrepreneur and influential member the Barcelona bourgeoisie. A close friend of Gaudí, he commissioned several of his works including Palau Güell, Bodegas Güell, Pabellones de la Finca Güell and the Colonia Güell crypt.

Park Güell's story begins in 1899 when Eusebi Güell bought two plots of land from Montaña Pelada, known today as today Monte Carmelo. His idea was to have Gaudí convert the land into a garden city, inspired by English gardens (so much so that the park's official name even took after English "park".

Despite Güell and Gaudí's dedication to the project, it was a commercial failure. It was thought that it would be possible to develop the area into a high-class residential neighbourhood with magnificent views overlooking Barcelona, but the high pricing and location a little outside of the city centre made it that only two plots of land were sold at the time. The current Casa-Museo Gaudí (Gaudí Museum House), where the architect lived between 1906 and 1925, was originally built to be a model home.

Work on Park Güell began in November 1900. During the first three years, Gaudí devoted himself to building the walls that surround the park, the entrance pavilion, a shelter for cars, the main entrance stairs, roads, viaducts, and sewers. Between 1904 and 1906 Gaudí built what is now the Gaudí Museum House, which was to be a model home. Around this time, Eusebi Güell realized that his plan for an entire residential neighbourhood would not be successful. However, work continued on, in particular the construction of the common areas of the residential park. In 1914, the beginning of the First World War put an end to Gaudí's work.
