A close friend of Gaud\xed, he commissioned several of his works including Palau G\xfcell, Bodegas G\xfcell, Pabellones de la Finca G\xfcell and the Colonia G\xfcell crypt. Park G\xfcell's story begins in 1899 when Eusebi G\xfcell bought two plots of land from Monta\xf1a Pelada, known today as today Monte Carmelo. His idea was to have Gaud\xed convert the land into a garden city, inspired by English gardens (so much so that the park's official name even took after English \"park\". Parc G\xfcell in Barcelona, Catalonia (Spain) Despite G\xfcell and Gaud\xed's dedication to the project, it was a commercial failure. It was thought that it would be possible to develop the area into a high-class residential neighbourhood with magnificent views overlooking Barcelona, but the high pricing and location a little outside of the city centre made it that only two plots of land were sold at the time. The current Casa-Museo Gaud\xed (Gaud\xed Museum House), where the architect lived between 1906 and 1925, was originally built to be a model home. Work on Park G\xfcell began in November 1900. During the first three years, Gaud\xed devoted himself to building the walls that surround the park, the entrance pavilion, a shelter for cars, the main entrance stairs, roads, viaducts, and sewers. Between 1904 and 1906 Gaud\xed built what is now the Gaud\xed Museum House, which was to be a model home. Around this time, Eusebi G\xfcell realized that his plan for an entire residential neighbourhood would not be successful. However, work continued on, in particular the construction of the common areas of the residential park. In 1914, the beginning of the First World War put an end to Gaud\xed's work.
