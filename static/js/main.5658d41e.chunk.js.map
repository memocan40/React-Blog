It has been continually occupied, in one form or another, from the Iberian era (4th century B.C) to present. During the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939) the Republican anti-air defence authority (DECA) found that the hill was the most suitable place to build its anti-aircraft battery, which was instrumental in republican efforts to defend Barcelona. Post Spanish Civil-War the then abandoned military structures were used as shelters and the shanty town of Els Canons, which survived into the ‘90s, sprung up around them. Also during this time, water tanks and communication towers were installed, some of which can still be seen to this day.</p></div>\r\n        </div>\r\n    )\r\n}","import React,{useState} from \"react\";\r\nimport {Route,Link,Switch}from \"react-router-dom\";\r\nimport \"./sagrada.css\";\r\n\r\n\r\nexport default function Sagrada(){\r\n\r\n\r\n    return(\r\n        <div className=\"sagrada\">\r\n        \r\n        <div className=\"contend\"><img className=\"bild\" src=\"https://go2barcelona.de/images/barcelona_sagrada_familia.jpg\"></img></div>\r\n\r\n        <div className=\"text1\">The Sagrada Familia (full name Basílica i Temple Expiatori de la Sagrada Família) is a large Roman Catholic church in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain. It was designed by architect Antoni Gaudí (1852–1926). Although it is not finished, the church is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.[5] In November 2010 it was consecrated (dedicated to a special purpose) and made a minor basilica by Pope Benedict XVI.[6][7][8] Building of the Sagrada Familia began in 1882. Gaudi started working on it in 1883.[5] He took over the project, and changed it with his ideas on architecture and engineering. Gaudi worked on it until he died. At the time of his death in 1926, less than a quarter of the building was finished.[9] The Sagrada Família's building was slow. It needed private donations (people giving money to it). It was stopped by the Spanish Civil War—only to start again in the 1950s. Building was more than halfway done after 2010. Some of the project's biggest problems still remain.[9]</div>\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <iframe className=\"frame\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/AWQje34khog\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n        \r\n        </div>\r\n    )\r\n}","import React,{useState} from \"react\";\r\nimport {Route,Link,Switch}from \"react-router-dom\";\r\nimport \"./next.css\"\r\n\r\nexport default function Next(){\r\n\r\n\r\n    return(\r\n        <div className=\"next\">\r\n            Work in progress.... coming soon!\r\n        </div>\r\n    )\r\n}","import React,{useState} from \"react\";\r\nimport {Route,Link,Switch}from \"react-router-dom\";\r\nimport \"./gaudi.css\";\r\n\r\n\r\nexport default function Gaudi(){\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    return(\r\n        <div className=\"Gaudi\">\r\n\r\n        <div><img className=\"firstpic\" src=\"https://image.stern.de/9039998/t/Kq/v5/w1440/r1.7778/-/212a-gaudi-fp-43429-1910291520-id-1279341.jpg\"></img></div>\r\n\r\n            <p className=\"textgaudi\">History of Park Güell\r\nPark Güell is named after Eusebi Güell, a wealthy Catalonian entrepreneur and influential member the Barcelona bourgeoisie. A close friend of Gaudí, he commissioned several of his works including Palau Güell, Bodegas Güell, Pabellones de la Finca Güell and the Colonia Güell crypt.\r\n\r\nPark Güell's story begins in 1899 when Eusebi Güell bought two plots of land from Montaña Pelada, known today as today Monte Carmelo. His idea was to have Gaudí convert the land into a garden city, inspired by English gardens (so much so that the park's official name even took after English \"park\".\r\n\r\nParc Güell in Barcelona, Catalonia (Spain)\r\n\r\n\r\nDespite Güell and Gaudí's dedication to the project, it was a commercial failure. It was thought that it would be possible to develop the area into a high-class residential neighbourhood with magnificent views overlooking Barcelona, but the high pricing and location a little outside of the city centre made it that only two plots of land were sold at the time. The current Casa-Museo Gaudí (Gaudí Museum House), where the architect lived between 1906 and 1925, was originally built to be a model home.\r\n\r\nWork on Park Güell began in November 1900. During the first three years, Gaudí devoted himself to building the walls that surround the park, the entrance pavilion, a shelter for cars, the main entrance stairs, roads, viaducts, and sewers. Between 1904 and 1906 Gaudí built what is now the Gaudí Museum House, which was to be a model home. Around this time, Eusebi Güell realized that his plan for an entire residential neighbourhood would not be successful. However, work continued on, in particular the construction of the common areas of the residential park. In 1914, the beginning of the First World War put an end to Gaudí's work.\r\n\r\nParc Güell in Barcelona, Catalonia (Spain)</p>\r\n\r\n<img className=\"firstpic\" src=\"https://previews.123rf.com/images/photoaliona/photoaliona1611/photoaliona161100172/68595716-s%C3%A4ulen-unter-den-b%C3%A4umen-aus-stein-im-park-guell-von-antoni-gaudi-in-barcelona-spanien-modernismus-stil-e.jpg\"></img>\r\n        </div>\r\n    )\r\n}","\nimport './App.css';\nimport {NavLink,Switch, Route}from \"react-router-dom\";\nimport Buncer from \"./views/Buncer\";\nimport Sagrada from \"./views/Sagrada\";\nimport Next from \"./views/Next\";\nimport Gaudi from \"./views/Gaudi\";\n\nfunction App() {\n\n \n  return (\n    <div className=\"App\">\n    \n\n      \n<ul>\n <NavLink activeClassName=\"current\" to=\"/home\"> <li><a>Home</a></li></NavLink>\n <NavLink activeClassName=\"current\" to=\"/buncer\"> <li><a href=\"#news\">Buncer Del Carmel</a></li></NavLink>\n <NavLink activeClassName=\"current\" to=\"/sagrada\"> <li><a href=\"#contact\">Sagrada</a></li></NavLink>\n <NavLink activeClassName=\"current\" to=\"/gaudi\"><li><a href=\"#gaudi\">Gaudi</a></li></NavLink>\n  <NavLink activeClassName=\"current\" to=\"/next\"><li><a href=\"#about\">About</a></li></NavLink>\n</ul>\n\n  <Switch>\n      <Route path=\"/buncer\">\n      <Buncer/>\n      </Route>\n      <Route path=\"/next\">\n        <Next/>\n      </Route>\n      <Route path=\"/sagrada\">\n        <Sagrada/>\n      </Route>\n      <Route path=\"/gaudi\">\n        <Gaudi />\n      </Route>\n      <Route path=\"/\">\n        <div className=\"text\">\n        <div className=\"first\" >Welcome to Barcelona</div>\n        <div className=\"second\"><h4>This is a short presentation about my last visit to Barcelona <br></br><br></br>\n        The City has some awesome places to go and I will show you some of these <br></br><br></br>\n        enjoy!</h4></div>\n\n        <div><iframe className=\"video\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/0cHbqAIw4zc?start=17\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n        </div>\n      </Route>\n      \n\n      </Switch>\n\n\n\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default App;\n","const reportWebVitals = onPerfEntry => {\n  if (onPerfEntry && onPerfEntry instanceof Function) {\n    import('web-vitals').then(({ getCLS, getFID, getFCP, getLCP, getTTFB }) => {\n      getCLS(onPerfEntry);\n      getFID(onPerfEntry);\n      getFCP(onPerfEntry);\n      getLCP(onPerfEntry);\n      getTTFB(onPerfEntry);\n    });\n  }\n};\n\nexport default reportWebVitals;\n","import React from 'react';\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom';\nimport './index.css';\nimport App from './App';\nimport reportWebVitals from './reportWebVitals';\nimport {BrowserRouter} from \"react-browser-router\";\n\nReactDOM.render(\n  <BrowserRouter>\n  <React.StrictMode>\n    <App />\n  </React.StrictMode>\n  </BrowserRouter>,\n  document.getElementById('root')\n);\n\n// If you want to start measuring performance in your app, pass a function\n// to log results (for example: reportWebVitals(console.log))\n// or send to an analytics endpoint.
